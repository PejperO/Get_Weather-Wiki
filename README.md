# Get_Weather-Wiki
The project, using [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) and [exchangerate.host](https://exchangerate.host/#/) , returns information about the selected city. It shows the current weather in the city, as well as displays a Wikipedia page dedicated to it. In addition, the program shows the current exchange rate between the selected currency and PLN

The program asks for three informations:
* City
* Country
* Currency
